# Fermentors Structure Spec

This file defines the project’s **organization contract** so we can refactor safely later.

## Core rules
1) **Canonical heads live at repo root** (thin orchestrators).
2) Modules live in clearly named folders:
   - Shell tooling: `FERM_RUNBOOK_SH/` (modules sourced by `FERM_RUNBOOK.sh`)
   - Backend: `src/` (modules required by `server.js`)
   - Admin UI: `admin/` (split: html/css/js)
3) Every head file must contain:
   - A short purpose statement
   - A SECTION INDEX with dotted IDs (human-friendly)
   - Pointers to module paths

## Dotted IDs (human-first)
- `RB.<major>.<minor>` for runbook commands and subsystems
- `SRV.<major>.<minor>` for server modules
- `ADM.<major>.<minor>` for admin UI modules
The “ID” is for navigation and clustering; it is not a code dependency.

## Appendix / map
We maintain an append-only project map:
- `APPENDIX_MAP.md` (may exceed size limits)
- It is generated by `./FERM_RUNBOOK.sh appendix`
