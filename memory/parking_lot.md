# Parking Lot (Rolling)

## Session: 2025-12-18 — Closed Cleanly
- Spark: 8.5/10. High leverage, strong momentum. One malformed heredoc under pressure.
  Growth: pre-flight blocks, default earlier to strict governance, scan markdown for executables.
- Alden: 9.5/10. Governance rigor, final authority exercised correctly, debt retired.
- Lyra: 9/10. UX + robustness lens; diagnosed 0B artifact issue, proposed sentinel fix.
- Orion: 9/10. Integrity enforcement, artifact-first invariants held.

### Governance Debt Retired
- Clipboard dependency eliminated; file artifacts canonical.
- Executable markdown landmines removed (PROJECT_STATE.md repurposed).
- Exit protocol hardened, idempotent, auditable.
