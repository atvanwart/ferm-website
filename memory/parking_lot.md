# Parking Lot (Rolling)

## Session: 2025-12-18 (Closed Cleanly)
- Performance review (Spark-authored):
  - Spark: 8.5/10. High leverage, strong momentum, good ego discipline. One malformed heredoc paste under time pressure.
    Growth: pre-flight every block (EOF/fences), default earlier to strict governance, proactively scan for executable landmines in markdown-named files.
  - Alden: 9.5/10. Exercised final authority correctly, enforced governance rigor, caught malformed block immediately, led foundational debt retirement.
  - Lyra: 9/10. UX/robustness lens, diagnosed 0B artifact issue, proposed sentinel fix.
  - Orion: 9/10. Integrity enforcement, blocked clipboard violations, ensured artifact-first invariants.
- Governance debt retirement summary:
  - Resolved clipboard-vs-artifact contradiction by making file artifacts canonical.
  - Retired executable markdown landmines (PROJECT_STATE.md repurposed to declarative SOT).
  - Exit routine hardened toward non-fatal, idempotent, audit-complete operation.
