# Session Last Summary (≤ 1,500 chars target)

Governance deadlock eliminated by making file artifacts canonical; runtime validated (server on :3000; /handshake/preview 200 OK); exit ceremony executed cleanly with complete artifacts and ordered next-start notes. Repo clean on main @ 5f1621b. Next session ignition: parse-check runbook, confirm git status, run 90_startup.sh alden, then proceed with Phase 1B commit spec or minimal exit hardening patch.
